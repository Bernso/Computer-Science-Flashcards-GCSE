## If you don't have python installed
If you do not have python installed you should download the .exe file as it already has all the needed components installed

## If you already have python installed
You should be able to install the file and run it, if this is NOT WORKING follow these instructions:
- Open command prompt
- Set the directory to where you installed the file. Example:
```text
cd Desktop
```
- Once you are in the correct directory run the command:
```text
python FlashCards-UI.py
```
- Now the gui should appear and there should be no problems

## When using the .exe file
If you use the .exe file and use the cross in the top corner to close the application it will not save the logs. To fix this please:
- Press on the exit button (it will come up with errors)
- Now you can close the app via pressing the red cross in the top corner (how you would normally close an application)
